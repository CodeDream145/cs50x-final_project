                <p> Firts of all, Welcome to "For Future Me". Great to have you here. My self is Pradhul Kannan M. You can call me "PK". The main and only purpose for making this website is to tell my future self (future Pk) that "I had done my first ever independent and very disciplined job. Yeah, there are some ons and offs, but it's only during the final project. I overcame lots of regrets but enjoyed all those disciplined days. I enjoyed time with my family, but beyond my family time, I love every bits and pieces of coding stuff. Sometimes experienced some sleepless nights just because of not typing enough codes. Hmmm... Love the coding and logic. I even made some new friends from Pakistan. Won cs50 quiz just because of them. And Mr. Pradhul Kannan, remember, it's all just for more and just for... Ha... "A Very Happy Life my boy." I am sure you are living your dream life, but in reality.</p>
