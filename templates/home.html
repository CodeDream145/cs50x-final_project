                <p>Firts of all, Welcome to the "Future Me". Great to have you here. My self is Mr. Pradhul Kannan, You can call me as "PK". The main and only purpose for making this website is to tell my future self(future Pk) that, "I had done my first ever independent and a very disciplined job. Yeah, there are some on and offs but it's only during the final project. Overcomed lots of regrets, but enjoyed all those disciplined days. I enjoyed time with my family but beyond my family time, I love every bits and pieces of coding stuffs. Sometimes I had experienced some sleep less nights just because of not typing enough codes. Hmmm... Love the coding and logics. Even got some new friends from pakistan. Won cs50 quiz just because of them. Hey If  you are living your dream life and working in something along with one of them. Remember they are the reason for your first cs50 victory... And Mr. Pradhul Kannan, Remember it's all just for more and just for... Ha... "A Very Happy Life my boy."</p>
